**"Voice Manager"** is a pet-project application designed for convenient use of a computer using voice commands. It provides the user with the ability to:
- Launch an applications, open files, 
- Open links in the default browser,
- Perform voice search
- Display counter-messages to the user's commands

You can observe the history of your requests and responses of "Assistant" in the form of a chat on the home page of the application.
Commands are available in two ways: **By voice** for the selected voice model in the ***"Additional settings"*** section or **by manually writing a command** on the keyboard in the message input field.

## Opening files, launching applications:

To add a new command to open a file you need to:

Go to the menu by clicking the button in the upper left corner -> Select the ***"File management"*** section -> Click the button at the bottom ***"Add new item"***.

Then you need to click on the button with the image of the file, and select the path to the desired file using the file dialog, the path will be displayed in the panel above, in the panel below you need to write a command that will act as a **"trigger"** to open the file, then you just need to click on the button ***"Add"***.

## Opening links in the default browser:

The procedure of adding a command to open a site by link is similar to adding a command to open a file. 

Go to the menu by clicking the button in the upper left corner -> Select the ***"Site management"*** section -> Click the button at the bottom ***"Add new item"***.
The only difference is the data that is specified to create the trigger.

## Displaying counter-messages to the user's commands:

Adding a new command to output a message in response to a user is similar to the previous two procedures.

Go to the menu by clicking the button in the upper left corner -> Select the ***"Response management"*** section -> Click the button at the bottom ***"Add new item"***.

## Voice Search:
When after a query from the user, no match was found among the **"triggers"**, the command will be taken as an internet search query.


### Conclusion
To summarise, Voice Manager provides an intuitive interface and some convenience in the working experience at the computer.
